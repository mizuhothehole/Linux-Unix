Shell command about how to use the "split" function like other languages and the / math usage

1. First I really do not catch the point but that the maining of split using "cut" command in shell is like this in fact
   1) To clear the indicated 1 character. Which means we can just appoint only one character. Not 2 chars.
   2) To make the left words into a range.
   3) To pick out any of the words in appointed position.
   
   For example,the real runtime is like below:
   
   xadxasd fsfsf   fsfssaf     fsafdfa fcasfasfas
   
   If we split by " ", they will be split into...
   
   xadxasd
   fsfsf
   fsfssaf
   fsafdfa
   fcasfasfas
  
2. Then we need to do the / mathmatic usage:

   shin@shin-X555LPB:~$ VALUE1=432423
   shin@shin-X555LPB:~$ VALUE2=543441
   shin@shin-X555LPB:~$ awk 'BEGIN{printf "%.2f\n",('$VALUE1'/'$VALUE2')}'
   0.80
   shin@shin-X555LPB:~$ awk 'BEGIN{printf "%.5f\n",('$VALUE1'/'$VALUE2')}'
   0.79571
